      <span class="firstLetter">A</span>business structure can be a complex web of all the parts and cogs 
       that fit together to make it a success or not. If you are providing a product or service at any level many factors 
       need to be considered to make it profitable
       or successful. From your workforce to your customers and from the components to make your products or services
       you offer to promoting your business all needs to be systemised and accounted for. Reports, invoices, stock control
       and accounts all need processing.

       We will be giving you great stuff from day one. The first projects will be a CRM with an email manager for customer 
       contact. A product manager and a time management system.  These first products will set you on the right path to a 
       well organised business system. It's then up to you to decide what you require next so we can continue to build a 
       complete package which is right for you.

      As you will be in the first 21 I am going to look after you. You get 60 hours of development time. 
      I am a seasoned software developer and I am right up to date with the latest techniques. Have you wanted to redesign 
      your web site? Do you want your customer to access your products and services from your website. This is the chance 
      for you to have this and more.

       We will ask for a years membership to Diamond Edge for this. That is only £1200, then after that you are in for £100 per month.
       Remember you are in the 21 the keys for the door others will pay much more to join the party later but you backed me early.
       I will always be greatful for that. I just don't want you pay any more than £100 per month going forward only taking inflation
       in to account. Others can pay more for the great value service going forward, not you.
       So be with me in the new and exciting internet sensation.
